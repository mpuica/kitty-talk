### Instructions or 'How to Meow'

Be warned! I was too lazy to do a proper session restore, 
so once you leave the page you have to sign-in with a new kitty 

- use a kitty image to sign-in 
- once signed in, you can publish your MEOWS 
- on the left side you have your profile, the crew members and all the community
- on the right side you have your MEOWS and your crew MEOWS ordered by date
- your MEOWS are highlighted
- any avatar you click will display the selected Kitty 
    with its own crew and onw MEOWS (crew MEOWS included)
- to get back to your profile, click on the top left (your) avatar
- on any page you are, any action on behalf of your account 
   (adding a new MEOW or adding a Kitty to your crew) 
   will return automatically to your page, 
   displaying your profile, your crew and your MEOWS
- adding a MEOW will automatically update your MEOWS
- adding / removing a crew member will automatically add or remove
   their MEOWS from your MEOWS list.
